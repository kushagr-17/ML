This model is trained using K-nearest neighbours algorithm. This was an experimental learning activity assigned in 4th semester. <br/>
We were to train the model by taking any value of the given parameters, k={2,4,5,6,7,10} and train:test = {60:40, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20, 90:10, 95:5} <br/>
I trained this model by taking **k=2** and splitting the training and testing data in the ratio **60:40**.
Rest of the scenarios are commented
